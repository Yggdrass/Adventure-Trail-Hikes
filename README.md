# Adventure Trail Hikes

![my image](images/adventure_trail_hikes_logo.png)

Create a website for young active adults that want to find a trail hike that suits them.


## Description

Adventure Trails Hikes is a new business offering extreme hiking in a number of different countries.
It offers supervised hikes, ranging from short day tours to weeklong treks, with camping. The service
is aimed at college-educated professionals (men and women) between the ages of 18 to 35.
The focus is not just on the experience of nature but also the specific nation's culture and traditions.
Hike experiences will typically include traditional meals, music/theatre, as well as contact with the
local population. Additionally, the emphasis is on sustainable, environmentally behaviour and
respect for the local culture.
The website should promote some of the hikes and could have a monthly/daily focus on a given
country/region. Maps, photos, package prices and travel details should be included.


For a detailed record of my work on this project, you can read that in the report file (.pdf) which is provided in the main folder.
